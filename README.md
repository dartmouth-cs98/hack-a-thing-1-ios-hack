# Zeta

This repository was created for an app called Zeta, originally meant for organizations to easily access the contact information for their leaders and other members.

The app was meant to be an offshoot of the iOS FoodTracker app tutorial, but this proved to be far more involved than originally expected. The functionality is currently only limited to the scope of the tutorial itself.
